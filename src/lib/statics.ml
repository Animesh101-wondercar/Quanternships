## Using This Repository

This repository is auto-updated by a GitHub action. The data are stored in OCaml structs in the `./src/lib/data.ml` file. They are compiled into Markdown by the Markdown_writer module, in which the output format can be changed (if needed). The data structure should be fairly intuitive. Follow the samples. On creating a new PR, a GitHub action will automatically update your branch's README.md file.
